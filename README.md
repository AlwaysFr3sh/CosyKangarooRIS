Assignment 3 for Software Architectures and Design Unit.

Based on discussion in discord, I have taken the liberty of setting up a Dotnet 6 cli project in c#

It's still early days so if I have jumped the gun and the group would rather use something else we can always make a new repo or just switch what we're using in this one.

I installed dotnet 6 on my computer from here:
https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0

I set up the project using microsoft's tutorial found here:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tutorials/with-visual-studio-code?pivots=dotnet-6-0

# Run the program with dotnet cli

```
cd src/
dotnet run
```
Or click the play button on vscode / visual studio etc.
